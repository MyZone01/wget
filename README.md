#   ðŸ§­ WGET
##  DESCRIPTION
Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.
These functionalities will consist in:
+   The normal usage of `wget`: downloading a file given an URL, example: `wget https://some_url.ogr/file.zip`
+   Downloading a single file and saving it under a different name
+   Downloading and saving the file in a specific directory
+   Set the download speed, limiting the rate speed of a download
+   Downloading a file in background
+   Downloading multiple files at the same time, by reading a file containing multiple download links asynchronously
+   Main feature will be to download an entire website, [mirroring a website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_site)

The program gives feedback, displaying the:
+   Time that the program started: it must have the following format **yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss**
+   Status of the request. For the program to proceed to the download, it must present a response to the request as status OK (`200 OK`) if not, it should say which status it got and finish the operation with an error warning
+   Size of the content downloaded: the content length can be presented as raw (bytes) and rounded to Mb or Gb depending on the size of the file downloaded
+   Name and path of the file that is about to be saved
+   A progress bar, having the following:
    +   A amount of `KiB` or `MiB` (depending on the download size) that was downloaded
    +   A percentage of how much was downloaded
    +   Time that remains to finish the download
+   Time that the download finished respecting the previous format
